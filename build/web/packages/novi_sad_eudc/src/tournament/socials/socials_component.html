            <h2>KAFANA MONTEVIDEO</h2>
            <p>In Serbian culture, term “Kafana” represents a gathering place, where drinks and food are combined with traditional music played by live performers. Over time, “Kafana” developed into a spot where generations meet to chat over drinks, enjoying their company, surrounding environment, and meeting new people.</p>
            <p>Kafana “Montevideo” (opened in 2015)  is a very popular spot of Novi Sad, and represents a perfect combination of traditional Balkan, and fresh modern music. The ambient of the place depicts the fusion in the perfect sense. With cool DJ’s and colorful spectrum of music, “Montevideo” will be our socials spot for two nights: Opening night, and after second day of rounds.</p>

            <h2>RIVER CLUB “DVA GALEBA”</h2>
            <p>Knowing how intense 3 days of rounds will be, and expecting debaters to be ready to relax, dance it out and have a few drinks, we’ve ensured a perfect venue! Big enough for everyone to find a corner for a chat, or a space to dance, “Dva Galeba” is one of the most popular night clubs of Novi Sad. Located on the river Danube, and booked only for us, “Dva Galeba” will have a professional DJ and assortiment of non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages. Also, don’t miss a night view of the Danube river - The refreshing winds might remind you of that horrible argumentative flaw you made in round 4, but the support of friends will most definitely turn the worst mistakes into a night to remember.</p>
            <p>Check out the virtual tour of the club on the following link: <a href="http://www.dvagaleba.360.rs/">http://www.dvagaleba.360.rs/</a></p>

        <h1>Finals & Championship dinner </h1>
        <!--<div class="translucent">-->
            <h2>“RIBARAC”</h2>
            <p>What would an EUDC look like without the realest events of them all - The Championship dinner? Especially if you are hoping to debate in front of hundreds of debate colleagues, and some VIP guests that might come and take a look of what is this debate thing people talk about?</p>
            <p>Knowing that finals after finals might sometimes be exhausting, we’ve ensured a venue that is surrounded by gardens and open areas, allowing you to take a walk, visit the river and get some peace and fresh air before the final round starts. We will be serving dinner too, but that’s not all - We will throw in a dance party to close the EUDC in a proper manner!</p>
            <p>Located on the bank of the Danube River, away from the city bustle, yet only 3 km away from the city center, “Ribarac” was a place we immediately fell in love with. And we are quite sure you will love it too.</p>
