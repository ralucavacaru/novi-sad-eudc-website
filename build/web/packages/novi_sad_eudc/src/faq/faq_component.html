        <h1>FAQ - Registration & Payments</h1>
        <h2>When will payments be due?</h2>
        <p>The payment deadline for the first round of allocations will be the 10th of April for a 50% deposit, the rest being due by no later than the 5th of May. After that, unconfirmed slots will be reallocated on a rolling basis, and institutions will have two weeks to confirm the slots after having received the offer.</p>
        <h2>I need an invoice. What do I do?</h2>
        <p>Invoices will be distributed after the initial round of allocations. You can contact the registration team at reg.novisadeudc@gmail.com.</p>
        <h2>Can we sell slots?</h2>
        <p>Institutional adjudicator slots may be traded. Team spots can not be sold or bought – all allocations will be made by our team to ensure fairness.</p>
        <h2>I have no idea how many teams my institution got.</h2>
        <p>You can find out <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SecxKnufLDcPbbxpG80OvKZBkcDQV-EHiK0Z3RW_bDs/edit#gid=0">here</a>.</p>
        <h2>My institution would like more slots, when is the next round of allocations?</h2>
        <p>Round 2 of allocations will be published around the 23rd of April. After that, we will reallocate slots on a rolling basis.</p>
        <h2>I missed the payment deadline, what do I do?</h2>
        <p>Email the registration team immediately at reg.novisadeudc@gmail.com and beg them for mercy. Once we have reallocated your slots, you can only get back at the bottom of the waiting list.</p>

        <h1>Independent Adjudicators</h1>
        <h2>Will the Independent Adjudicator applications start at the same time?</h2>

        <h2>Who can apply as an Independent Adjudicator?</h2>
        <p>Anyone can apply, however applying does not automatically guarantee an IA slot. All applications will be evaluated by the CA Team.</p>
        <h2>How large is the IA budget?</h2>
        <p>The budget is set at 10.000 EUR for travel subsidies.</p>
        <h2>I applied as IA, when will I get an answer?</h2>
        <p>We aim to get back to everyone by the 22nd of April.</p>
