        <h1>About Novi Sad</h1>
        <p>Novi Sad is second largest city of Serbia, the capital of the autonomous province of Vojvodina. It is located in the southern part of the Pannonian Plain,on the border of Backa and Srem geographical regions, on the banks of the Danube river, facing the northern slopes of Fruska Gora mountain.</p>
        <p>Novi Sad was founded in 1694, when Serb merchants formed a colony across the Danube from the Petrovaradin Fortress which was a Habsburg strategic military post. In the 18th and 19th centuries, it became an important trading and manufacturing centre, as well as a centre of Serbian culture of that period, earning the nickname of the Serbian Athens. The city was heavily devastated in the 1848 revolution, but it was subsequently restored. Today, along with the capital city of Belgrade, Novi Sad is the industrial and financial center of the Serbian economy. Novi Sad was named to be one of three 2021 European Capitals of Culture.</p>
        <p>History aside, Novi Sad is pretty amazing when it comes to gastronomy, nights out and wine tastings. Thanks to itâ€™s geographical position, the entire region is well known for great wines, but also local producers who are best known for cheeses, liquors and fresh vegetables.</p>
        <p>What you can expect from the city is amazing nights filled with laughter, warm Serbian mentality, great food, cheap drinks and nights at the Danube riverbank that will surely never be forgotten.</p>
        <p>Welcome to Novi Sad, and welcome to EUDC 2018!</p>
