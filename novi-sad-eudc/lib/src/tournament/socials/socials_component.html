        <h2>RIVER CLUB “DVA GALEBA”</h2>
        <p>Knowing how intense 3 days of rounds will be, and expecting debaters to be ready to relax, dance it out and have a few drinks, we’ve ensured a perfect venue! Big enough for everyone to find a corner for a chat, or a space to dance, “Dva Galeba” is one of the most popular night clubs of Novi Sad. Located on the river Danube, and booked only for us, “Dva Galeba” will have a professional DJ and assortiment of non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages. Also, don’t miss a night view of the Danube river - The refreshing winds might remind you of that horrible argumentative flaw you made in round 4, but the support of friends will most definitely turn the worst mistakes into a night to remember.</p>
        <p>Check out the virtual tour of the club on the following link: <a href="http://www.dvagaleba.360.rs/">http://www.dvagaleba.360.rs/</a></p>

        <h1>Finals & Championship dinner </h1>
        <h2>“RIBARAC”</h2>
        <p>What would an EUDC look like without the realest events of them all - The Championship dinner? Especially if you are hoping to debate in front of hundreds of debate colleagues, and some VIP guests that might come and take a look of what is this debate thing people talk about?</p>
        <p>Knowing that finals after finals might sometimes be exhausting, we’ve ensured a venue that is surrounded by gardens and open areas, allowing you to take a walk, visit the river and get some peace and fresh air before the final round starts. We will be serving dinner too, but that’s not all - We will throw in a dance party to close the EUDC in a proper manner!</p>
        <p>Located on the bank of the Danube River, away from the city bustle, yet only 3 km away from the city center, “Ribarac” was a place we immediately fell in love with. And we are quite sure you will love it too.</p>
